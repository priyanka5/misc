We are not a timekeeping company, but we provide services to the timekeepers so that they can publish online to Internet the times of passage through the control points.
I do not know if you know anything about timing, so I'll try to explain it in a few simple words, although you can look at the websites of companies that provide timing tools such as Chronotrack or Mylaps, which are sure to explain it better.
I tell you, the athletes have placed a passive disposable chip stuck on the bib that identifies them. At several control points, antennas or mants are placed that activate the chip when it passes over it. The chip responds with a signal and the system records the moment in which that signal has been produced (in fact it is more complex, but in a simple way it is like that).
We are connected in a network with the timing system that sends us the time of passage of the chip, we process that chip and that time to assign it to an athlete and we publish on our web page the passage of the athlete. We also publish it in our mobile app and make a publication on the athlete's wall on facebook and twitter (previously they must have registered, of course).
This system is complemented by an enrollment platform and an exclusive application for managing the profile of the athlete where they can see the results in all events, they can upload the documents needed to register for an event (medical certificate, parental permission, etc.).
We use keycloak to access the registration portal and profile management.

We have recently added another product to our system (www.pul-sos.com, although the web is not yet fully translated into English yet). It is a bracelet that athletes (or any other person, we have in fact provided coverage to an Alzheimer's disease association) for their safety. It is a silicone bracelet that has a unique QR code engraved. The athletes enter their profile and can incorporate the medical or emergency data they want.
In case of accident, loss or any circumstance in which the person is not able to respond, the paramedics (or anyone who can help them) can read the QR and a page with all the data of the person is presented. Here they can indicate previous illnesses, allergies, contact persons, etc.
The access to this portal for managing the profile and all the data that the user wants to appear when someone reads the QR is controlled by keycloak.","At first, we had real problems because Keycloak lacked some necessary services for us, but we adapted and improved our integration with Keycloak as the versions advanced. In the actual version of Keycloak there are many functions that we do not use, although being able to have a theme in the client and not the real level has been for us the last best contribution. Even now we have incorporated the possibility of authentication with X509 certificates.
The bad part was the beginning, because the learning curve is not trivial. But now, all projects that need authentication are based Keycloak.
The best part is undoubtedly the ease of use for our users and the ability to tunning the theme for each project in a simple way.

We are using Keycloak as the code authentication service. ","We are primarily using Keycloak to provide the Oauth2/OIDC authentication functionality for our microservice platform. We are not using it as the main repo of our user base, but only as a shadow of our user store in order authenticate users and provide bearer tokens, so we have implemented a few customizations in order to support our needs.  

Probably our most useful customization is that since our user interface is a React-based SPA, the requirement to do full-page redirects when authenticating a user is really antithetical to how an SPA needs to function. Not only does it require page changes, but is really limiting from a design and branding perspective since our customers will not have access to the keycloak server to customize themes. It also seems a little circa 2003. So I implemented a custom freemarker-based theme that returns json instead of the html. This allows our SPA to be able to better use and control that flow of data from Keycloak while still handling the redirects as needed and our customers will be able to implement their own UI designs without having to make changes to the Keycloak server.  A suggested enhancement would be to have an option to return actual json rather than having to shoehorn it into a freemarker templates.

Additionally, we support SMS based 2fa and because of the aforementioned use of an SPA, all of our multifactor support has to happen within our SPA, so we cannot use any of the Keycloak multifactor features since they are so ingrained with the redirect-based authentication flow. 

We are using many Keycloak realms to support our multi-tenant needs and Keycloak clients to represent our high level resources.  I think the most challenging thing about Keycloak is that many of the features related to clients and authentication flows are not very intuitive and took a lot of work to understand just how they function and their limitations. We also tried to user the authorization features of Keycloak for resource protection, but we found them to be rather limiting and not at all friendly to use.   So we only use Keycloak for user role assignments and then do the authorization of roles-based access externally, currently using Apiman with a custom plugin for supporting finer grained permissions. The authorization aspects of Keycloak while broad still feel very 1.0ish and not very useful. 

I do appreciate the availability  of the javascript-based authentication module. Though I have built some custom SPIs, the availability of the script module has dramatically increased our efficiency and flexibility for being able to quickly make changes. Two suggestions for that script module would be to allow access to the HTTP response so that we can set our own application cookies or other custom headers and it would be great if there were built in objects to make restful calls from within the script that could be integrated with the Keycloak  authentication functionality for passing bearer tokens, etc. At the moment, that all has to be done using custom javascript which is tedious and prone to error, but it seems like such a waste to not be able to take advantage of all of the Resteasy functionality that already exists under the covers.","Yes","Brute force protection;Events;Identity Brokering;OpenID Connect;Password policy;Token exchange;User Federation with LDAP;Realm or client roles;User Management;Customized freemarker template to return json instead of html","Keycloak JavaScript Adapter;Apiman integration using cusom policy plugin","Yes","Login","Authenticator;Event Listener","Mostly during the build process since we are running as Openshift containers.

","Docker","","Better SPA support.  More flexible role-based access capabilities.  More use case based doc. ","Great product overall. It just seems like it is designed for old school authentication needs and harder to use with more modern application architectures, despite all of the customization abilities. Keycloak clients seem overly complex and like they have become too much of a swiss army knife and are therefore confusing cause they can do too much.  Maybe things are intuitive to those with a background in security, but to everyone else, at times the Keycloak functionality is way too confusing than it needs to be. "

We also have a third application that currently uses Keycloak because we want to use the 2-factor authentication functionality. In the future we may use Keycloak as a single sign on between this third application and a fourth application.","It was pretty easy to start playing around with Keycloak because of how easy it is to just set up a standalone instance. We use the Java servlet adapter, which also works out of the box making it easy to see results fast.

I think the admin GUI is easy to understand, and easy to use, and the import functionality build in is very helpful. Especially in our case where our applications are white labeled and we have to create very similar realms whenever a new white label is added.

Working with the admin REST API was not great. I feel like the API is not well documented, and the behaviour is sometimes not predictable. There are also cases where the format of returned errors is randomly different, making it hard to handle these.

A more recent issue we ran into is using internationalization with Keycloak. While this functionality works, it's difficult to integrate when your application doesn't use the user management functionality in Keycloak. So if a user decides to change the language on our application, there is not much we can do to actually let Keycloak know. We can use the REST API, but that doesn't help because the KC_LOCALE cookie will still be set, meaning the change will be undone when the user logs in again.","No","Brute force protection;Import/export;Login pages;OpenID Connect;Password policy;Realm or client roles;User Management;admin REST API","Keycloak java servlet adapter with some parts overriden to match our needs.","Yes","Email;Login","","No","We heavily override some parts of code in the java servlet adapter to match our needs.

We therefore need a high degree of control over the user's login process, and the assurance of authenticity.

Keycloak is a good fit as the broker between external and internal identity providers, and our applications in an OpenID Connect landscape.  Users log in through federated services we subscribe to, such as Norwegian BankID, and are issued tokens with scopes and authenticity levels (levels of assurance) describing the login process.  These tokens provide security and user customization in a standardized fashion.","We have particularly enjoyed the fast development pace of Keycloak, and how easy it is to extend with new login and onboarding mechanisms.  We have complex requirements for integration with external identity providers.  This requires refinements to the default ""authentication flows"" provided by Keycloak.  And such refinements are very easy to add and verify (albeit with a ""private"" SPI library).

We have also found that having an opensource product simplifies error resolution, and have occasionally been able to provide patches accepted into the Keycloak project faster than a COTS product would have responded.  This simplifies the product management on our end.

The availability of Keycloak / Wildfly is very good.  Over two years, no outages have been caused by failures in the core components.

Off course, the rapid development leads to one of Keycloak's ""cons"".  Burst implementation before deadlines sometimes introduces unnecessary bugs, for instance in PKCE and tab sessions.  These have been resolved quite quickly, though.

Cluster management and High Availability also feels too complicated, and has so far caused the most anxiety during production upgrades.  As we use Keycloak as a standalone product, we would like it as decoupled from Wildfly as possible, with standard configurations suited for Keycloak as the only deployment.  Maybe with a ""keycloak.conf"" type file?

- not up-to-date with current version (3.4.3 refuses to export all 'secrets' for migration - no clue how to get around that)
- google indexes are swamped with no-longer-existing and old and duplicate documentation locations

- I am missing a concise list of which KC-defined roles for its various clients allow a user to do exactly what (or prevent her to do something)
- and lots more

The user interface and documentation around fine-grained admin permissions and policies scores 11 out of 10 in providing an incredibly frustrating user experience. The GUI exposes a maximum of complexity from the underlying implementation, without giving sufficient information to handle the complexity. UUIDs, for instance, are great internally, but in most of the places they are used (in fine-grained), for a user they are obscure references into the void (not searchable afterwards). Please try to attract GUI- and interaction designers to re-do this interface!
This pattern also affects other parts of the GUI: The event log lists UUIDs of users (instead of their names, perhaps even linking to that user ...), but one cannot *search* in the user window for their UUID. So: search with the browser page by page. But wait: the UUID on the page is abbreviated. So one has to delete the appropriate number of characters from the UUID 'harvested' from the event log. :-(

- Why is it so difficult to find out which users have a specific role/group? 'Users in Role' only lists users having that role *directly assigned*. Composite Roles, Groups or composite groups are not considered.
Effective roles in the User page (in a tiny space without search capability) list all the roles. But what if I encounter a Role this user should not have any more? There is no way to find out the (potentially multiple) paths this Role reaches this user (how about a list showing up hovering over the role?)

- It is very easy to get started with Keycloak. 
- User / Admin Documentation is a great help.
- The provided examples (keycloak-quickstarts) make it easy to adapt Keycloak to own applications.
- Keycloak is quite robust and runs without problems in production

Cons:
- SPIs and APIs has very little documentation, which makes it quite difficult to build correct custom integrations.
- The admin console is missing a global / client role overview. In the admin-console alone it is hard to find out which users have a particular set of roles. One needs to query the Keycloak database for this.
-  Customizing Keycloak with the CLI is doable but quite cumbersome. It would be great if there was something like a ""Keycloak distribution generator"" where a user could select database vendor, url, (except secrets) etc., desired infinispan clustering approach  (multicast, tcpunicast etc.) - similar to start.spring.io.
- Currently there is AFAIK no official recommendation about how to structure a Keycloak integration project. Would be great to give some recommendations about structuring a Keycloak integration project.
Most of the time companies will use stock Keycloak + custom theme + (custom extensions) which are either built into dedicated artifacts that are combined during deployment, or packaged as one big artifact or docker image.
We're using a combined approach where we have a dedicated keycloak-acme Project that includes the stock Keycloak server and adds themes and a set of custom providers in one build and produces one big artifact / docker image.
- Realm Import / Export story is not great. When trying to transfer a dev environment to staging/prod it is most of the time quite cumbersome to transfer the settings.
- When a Keycloak instance is upgraded, old realm configurations keep their old configuration - which is a good thing in general to avoid breaking something... but some settings, like e.g. the default Web Security Headers which changed over time, stay at the old stored (default) value which is potentially insecure by now. It would be great if Keycloak would be able to detect such ""insecure"" defaults from older versions and recommend to use the new (default) settings.","No","Account Management Console;Brute force protection;Events;Import/export;Login pages;OpenID Connect;Password policy;Token exchange;User Federation with LDAP;Realm or client roles;User Management;Custom Authenticators, OTP, Keycloak Admin Client, Service Accounts","Keycloak JavaScript Adapter;Keycloak Jetty Adapter;Keycloak Spring Boot Adapter;Keycloak Tomcat Adapter;Apache mod_auth_oidc;Custom Spring Boot 2 Integration https://github.com/thomasdarimont/spring-boot-2-keycloak-oauth-example ","Yes","Account;Email;Login","Authenticator;Credentials;Event Listener;Password Hashing;Password Policy;Protocol Mapper;Required Action;User Storage;Theme Resources;Theme Selector","- We use tcp-unicast for infinispan clustering, since keycloak nodes are running in different subnets which don't allow multicast","- We needed a way to create users without email addresses to integrate data from legacy system

- Initial issues revolved around the tenancy requirements, though perhaps now sorted with UMA and console permissions, because in a realm you were either and admin or not we ended up having to use many realms per project, which lend  to a users sprawl. 

- The administration for groups could use improvements, as assuming we were to reuse a realm, a single group section across multiple clients / projects would be impossible to manage. One idea would be much like roles which can be realm or client, we could do the same with groups.

- It would be nice to have a few more how-to around using the Authentication Flows. Around scripting and the extent we could customize? How could i say, if you don't have from this ip range, you must MFA? How do a throw out an log when a user is created? Can you block someone from continuing authentication if they don't have a particular role (at Keycloak, rather then client)? .. 
 
- Logging and auditing needs some improvement, it's difficult to workout what user has made the change and what the change was exactly.
